## Setup

Since this project is a React application, you will need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine to run it locally.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/TimiBee/react-weather-api-app-main.git](https://github.com/TimiBee/react-weather-api-app-main.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd react-weather-api-app-main
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Obtain an OpenWeatherMap API key:**

    * Visit the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/) and create an account.
    * Follow their instructions to obtain an API key.

5.  **Create a `.env.local` file:**

    * In the project's root directory, create a file named `.env.local`.

6.  **Add your API key to `.env.local`:**

    * Add the following line to the `.env.local` file, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key:

        ```
        REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
        ```

7.  **Start the application:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the development server, and the app will be accessible in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`).
